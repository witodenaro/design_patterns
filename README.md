### Each folder contains an implemented design-pattern inside the JavaScript language respectively.

They will contain the following files:
1. Problem file, which will contain a javascript code that has some issues inside of it (unreadable or difficult to modify or else)
2. Solution file, which will contain the necessary solution, as well as representing the implementation of the given design pattern.
- problem.js
- solution.js
